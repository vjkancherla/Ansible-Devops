- Some operations take quite a while (minutes or even hours). 
  For example, when you run dnf update or apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade, 
  it could be a few minutes before all the packages on your servers are updated.

- In these situations, you can tell Ansible to run the commands asynchronously, and poll the servers to see when the commands finish.

- Ansible starts the command very quickly on all your servers (especially if you set a higher -- forks value), 
  then polls the servers for status until they’re all up to date.

  To run a command in the background, you set the following options:
    -B <seconds>: the maximum amount of time (in seconds) to let the job run. 
    -P <seconds>: the amount of time (in seconds) to wait between polling the servers for an updated job status.

Example:

>> ansible multi -b -B 3600 -P 0 -a "apt -y update"

If you set -P 0, Ansible fires off the command on the servers, then prints the background job information to the screen and exits:

While the background task is running, you can check on the status elsewhere using Ansible’s async_status module, 
as long as you have the ansible_job_id value to pass in as jid:

>> ansible multi -b -m async_status -a "jid=169825235950.3572"
