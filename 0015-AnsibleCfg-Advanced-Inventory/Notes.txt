[1] In the earlier examples, we specified the path to the inventory file on the command line using -i hosts.ini. 
But we can avoid having to specify this path every time we run ansible commands by specifying the path to the 
inventory file in an ansible.cfg file that is also stored in the root directory of your project:

ansible.cfg
=====
[defaults]
inventory = pods-hosts.ini
host_key_checking = False


[2] We have a more advanced inventory file where we:
a. define multiple groups of servers (app, db)
b. define a "group of groups" to aggregate all server groups
c. global vars that will be applied to all server groups (username and ssh key)


TESTING
=====

====
Kubernetes hosts
====
>> k create -f test-deployment.yaml

>> k port-forward svc/app-svc-1 2222:2222

>> k port-forward svc/app-svc-2 2322:2322

>> k port-forward svc/db-svc-1 2422:2422


AdHoc Commands
===
>> ansible multi -a "hostname"

>> ansible multi -a "free -m"

>> ansible multi -a "date"
