IMPORTS
=========
- "import" refers to the process of including/importing other files in a playbook


IMPORT VARIABLES
-------------------
- We have already seen the most basic import - import a variables file into playbook:
    
    ----- 
    - hosts: all 

      vars_files:
        - vars.yml
    -----


IMPORT TASKS
-------------------
- Tasks can easily be included in a similar way. In the tasks: section of yourplaybook, you can add import_tasks directives.

- If you use import_tasks, Ansible statically imports the task file as if it were part of the main playbook, once, before the Ansible play is executed.

- Variables defined in the included tasks are available in the playbook scope.

EXAMPLE:
    -----
    - hosts: all
      
      vars:
        username: testuser 

      tasks:
        - import_tasks: imported-tasks.yml
    -----

    The imported-tasks.yml could look like this:

    ------
    - name: Add profile info for user. 
      copy:
        src: example_profile
        dest: "/home/{{ username }}/.profile" 
        owner: "{{ username }}"
        group: "{{ username }}"
      mode: 0744

    - name: Add private keys for user. 
      copy:
        src: "{{ item.src }}"
        dest: "/home/{{ username }}/.ssh/{{ item.dest }}" 
        owner: "{{ username }}"
        group: "{{ username }}"
        mode: 0600
      with_items: "{{ ssh_private_keys }}"

    - name: Restart example service. 
      service:
        name: example 
        state: restarted

    ------


IMPORT HANDLERS
--------------------
  - Handlers can be imported or included just like tasks, within a playbookâ€™s handlers section. For example:
    
   EXAMPLE
    -----------
    handlers:
    - import_tasks: handlers.yml
    -----------



  IMPORT PLAYBOOKS
  --------------------
    - Playbooks can even be included in other playbooks,

    EXAMPLE:
      ----
      - hosts: all 
        remote_user: root
        
        tasks: [...]

      - import_playbook: web.yml
      - import_playbook: db.yml
      ----
