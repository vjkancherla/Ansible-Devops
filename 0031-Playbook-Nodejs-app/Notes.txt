IMPORTANT POINTS FROM THE PLAYBOOK
======

[1] We are only running the playbook against a single server - "hosts: app-server-1.127.0.0.1.nip.io"

[2] We check if UFW is installed and stored the result in a ver - "register: ufw_pkg".
    The task to disable UFW is conditional (when: ufw_pkg.rc == 0). 
    It will only execute if the ufw_pkg.rc value is equal to 0, indicating that the ufw package is installed.

[3] The copy task copies the entire "app" folder

[4] We only start the nodejs app if its not running.
    - we first "register" the result of "/usr/local/bin/forever list" command in "forever_list" var
    - we then check if our app is listed in "forever_list" var. If not, we start it.
