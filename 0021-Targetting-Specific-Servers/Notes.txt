Since we are created groups of servers in our inventory file, it makes it easy for us to 
- target a specific group of servers 
- or, target a specific, individual server


>> ansible multi -a "hostname" 
Runs the command against all servers (aggregated by the "multi" group)

>> ansible app -a "hosts"
Runs the command against the server under the "App" group only

>> ansible app -a "hosts" --limit "app-server-2.127.0.0.1.nip.io"
Runs the command against the individual server - app-server-2.127.0.0.1.nip.io

# Limit hosts with a simple pattern (asterisk is a wildcard). 
>> ansible app -a "hosts" --limit "*.4"

# Limit hosts with a regular expression (prefix with a tilde). 
>> ansible app -a "hosts" --limit ~".*\.4"
