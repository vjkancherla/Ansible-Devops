TAGS
======

- Tags allow you to run (or exclude) subsets of a playbookâ€™s tasks.

- You can tag roles, included files, individual tasks, and even entire plays.

    =====
    # You can apply tags to an entire play.
    - hosts: webservers 
      tags: deploy

      roles:
        # Tags applied to a role will be applied to tasks in the role.
        - role: tomcat
          tags: ['tomcat', 'app']

      tasks:
        - name: Notify on completion.
          local_action:
            module: osx_say
            msg: "{{inventory_hostname}} is finished!" 
            voice: Zarvox
          tags:
            - notifications 
            - say

        - import_tasks: foo.yml 
          tags: foo
    =======

- Run the command below to only run the tomcat role and the Notify on completion task:
    >> ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags "tomcat,say"

- If you want to exclude anything tagged with notifications, you can use --skip-tags:
    >> ansible-playbook playbook.yml --skip-tags "notifications"
