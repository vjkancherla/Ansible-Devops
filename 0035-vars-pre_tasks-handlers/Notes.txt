VARIABLES
    - Using one or more included variable files cleans up your main playbook file, 
      and lets you organize all your configurable variables in one place. 


PRE-TASKS
    - Ansible lets you run tasks before or after the main tasks (defined in tasks:) or roles (defined in roles:—we’ll get to roles later)
      using pre_tasks and post_tasks, respectively.


HANDLERS
    - handlers are special kinds of tasks you run at the end of a play by adding the notify option to any of the tasks in that group. 
      The handler will only be called if one of the tasks notifying the handler makes a change to the server (and doesn’t fail), 
      and it will only be notified at the end of the play.
    - "ansible.builtin.meta: flush_handlers" is a way to force all notified handlers to run immediately at a specific point in your playbook.
