    "You may be wondering why sometimes quotes are used in these YAML playbooks, and sometimes not. I typically use quotes around my parameters in the following scenarios": [
        "If I have a Jinja variable (e.g. {{ variable_here }}) at the beginning or end of the line; otherwise YAML will parse the line as nested objects due to the braces.",
        "If there are any colons (:) in the string (e.g. for URLs).",
        "The easiest way to make sure youâ€™re quoting things correctly is to use YAML syntax highlighting in your code editor."
