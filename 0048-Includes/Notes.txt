INCLUDES
===========

- If you use import_tasks, Ansible statically imports the task file as if it were part of the main playbook, once, 
  before the Ansible play is executed.

- When you use include_tasks, Ansible treats the included tasks as a separate list of tasks that are executed within 
  the current playbook. They don't merge into the playbook itself but are executed in the order they appear in the included tasks file.

- Variables defined in the included tasks remain within the scope of those tasks. They are not available in the playbook's 
  scope unless you use the register module to capture values.

EXAMPLE:

    common_tasks.yml:
    -----
    - name: Ensure a specific directory exists
    file:
        path: /tmp/my_directory
        state: directory

    - name: Create a text file
    file:
        path: /tmp/my_directory/my_file.txt
        state: touch
    -----

    main_playbook.yaml
    ------
      - name: Include Tasks Example
        hosts: localhost
        tasks:
            - name: Include common tasks
            include_tasks: common_tasks.yml
    ------
